# threejs-laptop-animation

A simple interactive laptop animation made with Three.js (R3F)

This used to be a part of the new website I was working on for dahliaOS but I scrapped the rest of it and decided to keep this part only.
For those wondering, the shell that is "running" on the laptop is called Pangolin UI and it is used on dahliaOS.
